# Snippets

Often there are times I want to quickly reference code that I have used before but slightly forget it. So the plan is to organise everything into a gists, but then categorise them here so its easier to get to.

This is a simple UI that grabs my snippets via github gists, categorises them and puts them in a nice easy to find format.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
